**NOTE:** There is an issue with Webpack 5 and bcryptjs. Currently the only way to fix this issue is by manually going into `node_modules/bcryptjs/package.json` and change `"browser"` from this:

```
"browser": "dist/bcrypt.js"
```

To this:

```
"browser": {
  "bin": "dist/bcrypt.js",
  "crypto": false
}
```

This isn't an issue for the finalized app because I'll be building a cross-platform binary with Electron, but for development purposes I felt it was important to include this fix mentioned above.

## Download production app

A download link to the finalized production app version will be posted here...

## Usage

**NOTE**: In order to first log in to this app, you must manually insert a registration code into the MongoDB database on your instance of the AspireWithAlinaServer with the following properties:

```mongosh
db.students.insertOne({
  "registrationcode":"<your-desired-registration-code>",
  "emailaddress":"<your-email-address>",
  "firstname":"<your-first-name>",
  "lastname":"<your-last-name>"
})
```
